# Python Virtual Environments: A Comprehensive Guide

## What is a Virtual Environment?

A Python virtual environment is an isolated, self-contained directory that contains a specific Python interpreter and a set of installed packages. It allows you to:

- Manage project-specific dependencies
- Avoid conflicts between different project requirements
- Ensure reproducibility across different development machines

## Why Use Virtual Environments?

1. **Isolation**: Prevents package conflicts between projects
2. **Reproducibility**: Easily share and recreate project environments
3. **Clean System**: Keeps your global Python installation clean
4. **Version Control**: Manage different package versions for different projects

## Creating a Virtual Environment

### Using `venv` (Recommended for Python 3.3+)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

When you are in a virtual environment, your Terminal prompt will have "(venv) " prefix, to look like this:
(venv) [user@host path/to/your/project]$

# Install project dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run tests
```bash
python -m pytest test_file_renamer.py -v
```

# Common Virtual Environment Commands

## Activate
source venv/bin/activate

## Deactivate
deactivate

## List installed packages
pip list

## Freeze current packages (for requirements.txt)
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Cleaning Up

## Remove Temporary Files
```bash
deactivate
# Remove Python cache files
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete

# Remove entire virtual environment
rm -rf venv
```

# Potential Pitfalls

- Global Installation: Avoid pip install without an active virtual environment
- Dependency Conflicts: Always use requirements.txt to manage dependencies
- Python Version: Ensure you're using the correct Python version for your project

# Best Practices

- Create a virtual environment for each project
- Use requirements.txt to track dependencies
- Include venv/ in your .gitignore
- Activate the virtual environment before development or testing

# Troubleshooting

If deactivate doesn't work, close and reopen your terminal

Use ```which python``` to verify the active Python interpreter

If in doubt, recreate the virtual environment

- virtualenv: Older virtual environment tool
- conda: Anaconda's environment management system
- poetry: Modern dependency management and virtual environment tool
